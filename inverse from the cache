## Write a short comment describing this function
## cacheSolve is a function which computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the 
## inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached result")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(inv)
  inv
